**Hi fellow engineers,**

It is said that programming is part practical and part theory and finding the right balance between these two skills is essential when learning how to read and write code in any programming language. By learning how to program, you develop the ability to express solutions to problems so that a computer can execute those solutions. Much of the effort in programming is spent finding and refining solutions. Often, a problem is only fully understood through the process of programming its solution. While the programming language landscape offers many options, we will be exploring this required skill through the lens of the C++ Programming Language. This language fits into a category referred to in today’s parlance as Native Languages and they are used to implement, to varying degrees, much of the code that drives our most critical platforms and products.

**A Note on the C Programming Language**

We wanted to touch on a very common topic regarding how to get started. It has long been believed that in order to learn C++, once must first learn C. Nothing could be further from the truth. C can be thought of largely as a subset of C++, and so if you already know C++, learning C will come down to the following:

- Understanding where C isn’t a subset of C++
- Understanding which C++ features are missing from C and which facilities and techniques can be used to compensate

C is the closest relative of C++ and compatible in many ways, so a lot of your C++ knowledge will carry over quite naturally.

The #CODE++ Team will evaluate the feasibility in covering the C Programming Language in a later series.

To get better at anything, it takes practice, so here are some excellent resources that can be used to get (re)started with C++.
