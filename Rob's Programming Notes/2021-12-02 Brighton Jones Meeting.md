Attendees: Jes, Hennah, Andrew, Rob, and Carolina (for a bit).

1. Jes hosted Thanksgiving for the first time.
	1. Felt like she blacked out (so much to do, like being drunk).
	2. She's a perfectionist.
	3. Pie crust from scratch.
2. Andrew went to MIL's house
	1. Lamb shank instead of turkey.
3. Hennah
	1. Aunt's house.
	2. Catered this year.
	3. Too perfect.
4. 25 minutes and a couple of actions
	1. Cash buildup in bank.
		1. [ ] $60,000 from the bank in Carolina's checking account at NWFCU.
			1. ==$30K: Fund Charlie's UTMA from here.==
			2. ==$30K: Move to Fidelity joint account.==
			3. _==Open the UTMA in my name since it's easier to get hold of me.==_
			4. After the call, I signed the paperwork that Hennah generated while we were on the call!
	2. Sell Microsoft stock from Nov 30.
		1. We sold this stock (while I was screen-sharing with Andrew).
		2. _==Sold ~ $33K between Oct 15th and Nov 30th vestings.==_
		3. We can transfer this to Charlotte's new UTMA account (see below for what a UTMA account is, see above about moving funds).
	3. ESPP maxed out?
		1. _==Yes it was==_.
	4. Roth IRA maxed out?
		1. Yes.
		2. _==Reduced from 49% to 0% while screen-sharing with Andrew since I've already contributed the max of ~$28K.==_
	5. Increase my percentage (withholding?) so that we owe less tax.
		1. _==Increased from 22% to 24% (I think) with Andrew while screen-sharing.==_
	6. Irrevocable Trust for Charlie.
		1. Set up a bank account instead and gift money into there.
		2. Just add the bank account to the trust?
			1. No, link it.
			2. POD - designation that transfers upon death
			3. Or a UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) account
				1. Available to her at 21 years old.
			4. One year of gifting doesn't amount to much.
			5. Low risk.
			6. Charlotte would have access to the account at any time.
		7. Set up trust next year.
		8. Put $30K to UTMA.
		9. Put everything else in trust next year.
		10. Get money out of our estate and into hers.
		11. This is setting up a trust for Charlotte independent of us.
		12. We can decide when she gets access to the trust.
		13. $30,000 is what they recommend.
			1. $15K per person per year can be gifted from each of us, $30K total.
		14. Needs to be done by December 20th to be in this year.
		15. Next year, bumped up to $16K, so $32K total but will go into the trust.
		16. She will have irrevocable.
		17. We have revocable.
		18. You can change the terms of a trust at any time and frequently.
		19. _==You just can't take the money back to yourself once it's in there if it's irrevocable.==_
		20. Jes said this will be a win down the line.
	7. Carolina joined (Jes called her a Zoom bomber) from 1 to 1:15.
		1. She agreed to UTMA account.
