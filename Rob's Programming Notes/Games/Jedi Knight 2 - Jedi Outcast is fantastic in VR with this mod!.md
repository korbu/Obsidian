[Wish Vader Immortal was more? Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast is fantastic in VR with this mod! (Requires Link) : OculusQuest (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/e63y51/wish_vader_immortal_was_more_jedi_knight_2_jedi/)

Purchase on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/6030/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Knight_II__Jedi_Outcast/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/6030/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Knight_II__Jedi_Outcast/)

1.  Go to your install directory (default would be: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Jedi Outcast\GameData`)
2.  Then download and replace the contents of the mod [here](https://github.com/xLAva/JediOutcastLinux/tree/VR-Touch/binary/win32) into that GameData folder
3.  For full decoupled motion controls, you may need to manually activate it once you launch the game (can’t remember if this was necessary)

If you do, press the tilde key to bring up the console and type: hmd_useHands 1

The first time playing, you’ll also need to set the controls in the main menu (assign the trigger to shoot, A to open doors, etc.) if you didn’t copy the controls pak file in the mod GitHub. Also, for some reason, I had to toggle the EAX in the sound menu in-game for the super epic Star Wars music to play.

What about Jedi Knight 3: Jedi Academy?

There's this: [https://github.com/xLAva/JediAcademyLinux](https://github.com/xLAva/JediAcademyLinux) I haven't tried it yet, but I don't know if they did the motion controls for it. It uses the same engine as JK2, so it might not be hard to update it yourself
