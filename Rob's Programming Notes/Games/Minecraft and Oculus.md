[Minecraft on Quest 2 (How to play Bedrock VR Tutorial) - Official Way - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf3DLHnBRnk&t=122s)

For all of those wondering why the game isn't on the Oculus store, that's because it has been removed. Here's another way to do it starting from fresh:

1. Step 1: Have a purchased copy of Minecraft Bedrock (I haven't tried the one from Xbox gamepass for PC).
2. Step 2: Download the Oculus software and do all necessary setups.
3. Step 3: From your desktop, right-click your wallpaper, press "New", then press "Shortcut" and this should bring you to a window that asks you to create a shortcut by inputting something in the bar. In that same bar, copy and paste this exact text: `minecraft://Mode/?OpenXR=true`
4. Step 4: Press next and it should bring you to page that asks you to name the shortcut, you can name this whatever you want. Once you have a name, type it and then press finish.
5. Step 5: A new shortcut with the Minecraft image should be created with the name you chose.
6. Step 6: Now, plug in your Oculus Quest (make sure Minecraft IS NOT running) and from the Main Menu, Press the area that shows the Clock, battery, and WI-FI. Once pressed, you should see the big "LINK" button at the far right, press it and it should bring you to another room in your VR.
7. Step 7: At the bottom, there's a long bar that shows white pictures, press the one that has a monitor (i.e. Open desktop), it should mirror your PC desktop and once it does keep the Oculus app open or else it will kick you out. Now open the Minecraft shortcut from STEP 5 and boom you're in VR (One thing I saw that was recommended was to activate "OpenXR runtime" from the Oculus app on your PC before you start Minecraft). It should take a while to boot up but once it does, select a world and after it loads, press "Y" on your controller to change into VR mode.

I know it seems like a lot but I made it as clear as I can because It was a pain for me to do for the first time.
BTW this was all done on a Quest 2 and Virtual Desktop IS NOT NEEDED IN ANYWAY.
