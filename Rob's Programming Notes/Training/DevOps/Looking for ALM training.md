DevOps practices is technology agnostic enablement.  Then you have Azure and VSTS/TFS that is the platform and tools that enable MSFT and non-MSFT workloads/tools/languages/etc.  We don’t have a workshop – mainly just sample content from Parts Unlimited (http://aka.ms/PartsHOL) and this lit up in the DevOps fundamental Ch9 series: http://aka.ms/DevOpsFundamentals

The following MVA courses could be useful If you are interested how it works for OPS part

We just recorded some Microsoft Virtual Academy Sessions on all the New stuff in TFS/VSTS. The content should be published either this week or next. Will send the links out when they become available.

Here is a document that I share with customers related to good resources for information on Build and Release Management. Feel free to share.

Check out edx and mva too. – eg https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-devops-microsoft-dev212x-0 and [https://mva.microsoft.com/search/SearchResults.aspx#!q=devops&lang=1033](https://mva.microsoft.com/search/SearchResults.aspx#!q=devops&amp;lang=1033)   (there is sometimes some duplication/replication between the 2)

http://www.itproguy.com/how-to-enable-devops-practices-with-partsunlimited-apps/ is also very useful (hands on labs etc)

Hi Alexander,

Devops has been in quite a spin for this last couple of years and not only in the Microsoft stack.

I don’t know of a particular training, but instead there are several lectures, posts that complement each other.

I highly recommend the following:
- Go to //learning and search for devops. You will find several topics including many TechReady content
- Donovan Brown (Mr DevOps J ) has several interesting posts on the devops stack on his blog http://donovanbrown.com/
- Channel 9 has also an interesting series on the topic. https://channel9.msdn.com/Search?term=devops#ch9Search

    Regarding books, I like the list provided in these technet posts (although I haven’t got through all of tem yet)
- https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/devops/2014/05/05/top-10-devops-books-for-it-operations/
- https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/devops/2015/02/23/more-top-10-devops-books-for-operations/

    It is very interesting that your experience has been on non-MS stack.

    Keeping an open mind when addressing our customers is IMHO a good approach.

   

    Com os melhores cumprimentos / Best regards

Hey all,

I recently handled a devops project that fell into my lap, though it was entirely non-Microsoft software, and really enjoyed it. I’m looking to expand my horizons and dig a little deeper. Anyone have any recommendation on good training, either online or in-person? Any good books?

Thanks,

Alex
