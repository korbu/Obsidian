        - <span style="background-color:white">Comments from Vinicius Xavier on Corpnet:</span>
            - <span style="background-color:white">Great content to read. In particular, many customers I know take this site, book and author as reference for their microservices implementations.</span>
                - <span style="background-color:white">Keep in mind that what he writes is thinking about Java and CloudFoundry</span>
                - <span style="background-color:white">Another good book that is referenced very often is&amp;#160;</span>[this one](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/)<span style="background-color:white">, from O’Reilly. Safari has it, free to read online/app for any person with a @microsoft.com address.</span>
            - <span style="background-color:white">Some other good papers can be found in nginx documentation website. The same author is writing for them too. Of course, he writes in a way that promotes nginx too but is still very useful.</span>
            - <span style="background-color:white">The hidden gem I still haven’t found are books or resources going deeper on DR strategies for microservices implementations. These are going to be useful for mission-critical systems that decide to go the microservices path.</span>
