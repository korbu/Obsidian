[edex-ui](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui) is a cross-platform, customisable science fiction terminal emulator with advanced monitoring & touchscreen support.

eDex-UI is made with finesse but it hardly funtional as it hogs up resources. It is something that you should checkout and bin it later. It’s super cool in a nerdy way.

> Installation: brew install — cask edex-ui

This does exactly what it says. You can use it to read aloud a text file in a voice you like. You can also create an audio file of the read text. Can be used for text-to-speech conversion or to make a quick audio message.
