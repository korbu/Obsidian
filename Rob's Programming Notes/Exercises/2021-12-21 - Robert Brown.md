(I was 16 minutes late due to troubleshooting live site with Kris Fritz and making DC changes)
1. 5 minutes on treadmill.
2. Foam Roll.
3. Put half moon against wall.
	1. Put right foot against door frame on top of half moon as high as possible.
	2. Lean towards wall 20 times.
	3. On the 20th rep, hold against wall.
	4. Repeat with left foot.
4. Put foam block against wall.
	1. Lay it flat if standing it up hurts too much.
	2. Put right foot against door frame on top of foam block as high as possible.
	3. Lean towards wall 20 times.
	4. On the 20th rep, hold against wall.
	5. Repeat with left foot.
5. Put soft foam roller between knees.
	1. Put heels on floor, toes up on half moon.
	2. Bend forward, trying to touch the floor, pushing your hips back.
	3. Putting the soft foam roller between your knees keeps you from bending your knees and forces you to push your hips back.
	4. Repeat 10 times, 3 sets (?).
	5. On the third set, get a light (10 lb.?) kettle bell to help pull your stretch down to the floor.
6. See how low you can squat.
7. Wrap heavy red band around something like a treadmill.
	1. Put right leg through the band and push it as high up against your groin as possible.
	2. Put that knee on the far left side of the blue foam square, making sure to move the square far to the left of the treadmill so there's a stretch against your leg.
	3. Stretch your left knee to the left so there's a good distance between your knees.
	4. Turn your right foot out slightly toward the treadmill.
	5. Now lean directly to the left (and not backward) away from the treadmill 10 times.
	6. You should feel a good stretch in the groin.
	7. Repeat 10 times.
	8. Switch legs and repeat.
	9. Do 2 or 3 sets.
8. See how low you can squat.
9. Get the 20 lb. kettle bell.
	1. Hold it up in the goblet position.
	2. Squat as low as you can, holding the kettle bell up, keeping your head up, and keeping your back straight.
	3. Hold for 15 seconds.
	4. Breathe!
	5. Repeat for 30 seconds.
	6. Repeat for 45 seconds.
10. See how low you can squat.
