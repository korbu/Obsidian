1. Put a chair out.
	1. Put the blue square pad on the floor.
	2. Put both knees on the pad.
	3. Put the top of one foot on the chair.
	4. Bend the opposite leg's knee and put that foot in front of you, centered, i.e., not to the left or the right of center in front of you.
	5. Put one hand on a foam roller stood up on its end for balance.
	6. Keep your back as straight up as possible.
	7. Rock hips back and forward (like sex, per Robert).
	8. It shouldn't hurt to stretch the quad of either leg as you stretch.
	9. Once you do this often enough, your butt should touch the foot that's on the chair.
2. 90 degree legs.

	2. With right foot in the back, lean as far right as you can.

	5. Then hold the left leg steady and spread the right foot as far left as it will go, 10-12 reps.
4. Put the blue square pad on the floor.
	1. Put your left knee on it (I think).
	2. Put your right leg out to the right, but not too far or you won't feel this in your glutes.

	6. Repeat the above on the left side.
5. Squats

	2. Feet normal, not quite shoulder width apart, squat low.
